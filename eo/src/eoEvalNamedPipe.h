/** Communicate through a named pipe FIFO to evaluate an individual.
 *
 * With this class, you can plug an external process computing the fitness
 * of a serialized solution with a process hosting the EO algorithm.
 * Both processes just have to read/write solutions/fitness in files.
 *
 * The code would work with any file, but it is actually only useful with
 * FIFO pipes, which are blocking on I/O.
 * Thus, the process actually computing the fitness will ait for the solution to be wrote,
 * then compute and write the fitness back, waiting it to be read.
 * Conversely, the EO process will wait after having wrote the solution, that the other process
 * actually read it, then wait itself for the fitness to be read in the pipe.
 * With pipes, the synchronization of the two processes is guaranteed.
 *
 * To create a named FIFO pipe under Linux, see the command `mkfifo`.
 *
 * @note: if you use a single pipe for input/output, take care
 * of the synchronization with the process handling the fitness computation.
 * In particular, the first call of eoEvalNamedPipe
 * is to write the solution, THEN to read the fitness.
 *
 * @note Tested only under Unix systems, may not be portable as is.
 *
 * Use the default string serialization of the EOT and
 * the default deserialization of the fitness.
