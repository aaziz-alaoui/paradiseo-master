/** A vector of eoForge which hold an index.

 * To be used in conjunction with a subclass of an eoAlgoFoundry,

 * and hold the link to the encoding. @see eoAlgoFoundryEA
 *
 * As with eoForgeVector, adding a managed operator
 * is done through public member variable's `add` method,
 * which takes the class name as template and its constructor's parameters
 * as arguments. For example:
 * @code
 * eoOperatorFoundry< eoSelectOne<EOT> > selectors;
 * selectors.add< eoStochTournamentSelect<EOT> >( 0.5 );
 * @endcode
 *
 * @warning If the managed constructor takes a reference YOU SHOULD ABSOLUTELY wrap it
 * in a `std::ref` when using `add` or `setup`, or it will silently be passed as a copy,
 * which would effectively disable any link between operators.

/** Interface of a Foundry: a class that instantiate an eoAlgo on-the-fly, given a choice of its operators.
 *
 * The chosen operators are encoded in a vector of indices.
 *
 * The foundry subclass should first be set up with sets of operators of the same interface,
 * held within an eoOperatorFoundry member.
 * @code
 * eoOperatorFoundry< eoSelectOne<EOT> > selectors;
 * @endcode
 *
 * In a second step, the operators to be used should be selected
 * by indicating their index, just like if the foundry was an array:
 * @code
 * foundry = {0, 1, 2};
 * //         ^  ^  ^
 * //         |  |  |
 * //         |  |  + 3d operator
 * //         |  + 2d operator
 * //         + 1st operator
 * @endcode
 *
 * If you don't (want to) recall the order of the operators in the encoding,
 * you can use the `index()` member of eoOperatorFoundry, for example:
 * @code
 * foundry.at(foundry.continuators.index()) = 2; // select the third continuator
 * @endcode
 *
 * Now, you must implement the foundry just like any eoAlgo, by using the eoPop interface:
 * @code
 * foundry(pop);
 * @encode
 * It will instantiate the needed operators (only) and the algorithm itself on-the-fly,
 * and then run it.
 *
 * @note: Thanks to the underlying eoOperatorFoundry, not all the added operators are instantiated.
 * Every instantiation is deferred upon actual use. That way, you can still reconfigure them
 * at any time with `eoForgeOperator::setup`, for example:
 * @code
 * foundry.selector.at(0).setup(0.5); // using constructor's arguments
 * @endcode
 *
 * @warning If the managed constructor takes a reference YOU SHOULD ABSOLUTELY wrap it
 * in a `std::ref` when using `add` or `setup`, or it will silently be passed as a copy,
 * which would effectively disable any link between operators.
